# Meowa Game Assets

This skill is a stable loader for the current Meowa game-assets guide.

## Required First Step

Before choosing any Meowa command or workflow, fetch the latest guide:

```bash
python3 meowart_api.py skill-doc --task "<brief user request>"
```

If you are already in the `skills/game-assets/` directory, use:

```bash
python3 ./meowart_api.py skill-doc --task "<brief user request>"
```

If you are calling the script from the skill repository root, use:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py skill-doc --task "<brief user request>"
```

Follow the returned Markdown for command selection, API details, templates,
output directories, and validation steps. The command automatically falls back
to bundled `meowart_api.md` if the remote guide is unavailable.

## Diagnostics

Use these commands when the dynamic guide or runner version needs inspection:

```bash
python3 meowart_api.py skill-doc-status --check
python3 meowart_api.py bootstrap-status --check
```

`meowart_api.py` also has a bootstrap wrapper. Normal command runs silently
check the remote runner manifest, download a newer checksummed runner when
available, and execute that cached runner. This updates the CLI runner only.
Changes to this loader file still require reinstalling/updating the skill and
restarting Codex.

## Fixed Rules

- Do not expose API keys, developer keys, signed URLs, or other secrets in chat.
- Prefer environment variables or a local `.env` for credentials.
- Do not call bare `/generate` or `/api/generate`; use the current guide for the correct Meowa endpoint.
- For pixel assets, previews and manual resizing must use nearest-neighbor sampling.
- Do not manually shrink pixel art for display; if a smaller final asset is needed, use the workflow or post-processing path specified by the current guide.
- Generated outputs should be placed in an explicit task directory so the files are easy to inspect and reuse.
